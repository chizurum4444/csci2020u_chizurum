Run the server first, then the Main 2 which is the UI of the bulletin board.

Next run the Main which is the client UI followed by running the client. (ISSUE: For some reason the server picks up the connection when the UI for the client is started up)

MAIN ISSUE: Text doesn't show up in textArea after hitting the send button.
